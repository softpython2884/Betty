# **App Name**: CodeQuest Academy

## Core Features:

- Interactive Quest Tree: Display the school's curriculum as an interactive, graphical tree, visualizing completed quests, available paths, and locked future quests.
- FlowUp Integration: Link CodeQuest Academy projects to FlowUp via the FlowApps API, creating real, private projects in the student's FlowUp workspace for each accepted Quest. Upon registration, require entry of FlowUp User UUID and fpat token to the system. Provide a consent workflow and user interface. When accepting a Quest, call the FlowApps API to create a new private project.
- Professor Dashboard: Provide a central hub for managing the academy, with student management, a visual Quest editor, dynamic quest creator, quiz builder, and grading queue.
- Student Portfolio: A portfolio page displaying the student's level, XP progress, badges, achievements, completed quests, and links to public projects.
- AI Mentor: Integrate an AI assistant to provide contextual help within the CodeSpace, such as explaining algorithms, debugging errors, and refactoring code. The AI mentor tool is configured to provide hints and ask questions, guiding students towards solutions without directly providing code.
- Gamification: Award XP for completing quests and quizzes. Use levels and badges to gamify the learning experience.
- Secure Vault: Offer each user a private, secure project within FlowUp to store sensitive information like personal API keys, for enhanced security during the learning process.
- Peer Review System: Before a final Quest submission, students can be prompted to review the Project of one or more peers, providing constructive feedback based on a professor's rubric.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#E53935) to convey a sense of urgency, importance, and excitement, in alignment with the need for a dynamic learning experience.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), very desaturated, creating a neutral backdrop that is easy on the eyes for extended periods of use. The lightness of the background aligns well with the red.
- Accent color: A slightly desaturated orange (#FF7043), analogous to red. The reduced saturation helps it remain harmonious with the primary red.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, offering both modernity and warmth.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a high-contrast modern serif, providing an elegant and fashionable touch when combined with 'PT Sans'.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use consistent, professional icons to represent different quest categories and functionalities.
